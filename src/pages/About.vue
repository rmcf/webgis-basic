    <div class="text-body1 q-mt-md q-mb-md">
      Single page application (SPA) is a single page (hence the name) where a
      lot of information stays the same and only a few pieces need to be updated
      at a time.
    </div>
    <div class="text-body1 q-mb-md">
      For example, when you browse through your email youâ€™ll notice that not
      much changes during navigation - the sidebar and header remain untouched
      as you go through your inbox.
    </div>
    <div class="text-body1 q-mb-md">
      The SPA only sends what you need with each click, and your browser renders
      that information. This is different to a traditional page load where the
      server re-renders a full page with every click you make and sends it to
      your browser.
    </div>
    <div class="text-body1 q-mb-md">
      This piece by piece, client side method makes load time must faster for
      users and makes the amount of information a server has to send a lot less
      and a lot more cost efficient. A win-win.
